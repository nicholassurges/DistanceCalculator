# DistanceCalculator

Distance Calculator Visual Basic Studios 2012

If you know a vehicle's speed and the amount of time it has traveled, you can calculate the distance it has traveled as follows: Distance = Speed * Time.

Create an application to caclualte the distance. When the user clicks the Calculate button, the application should display an input box asking the user for the speed of the vehicle in miles-per-hour, followed by another input box asking for the amount of time, in hours, that the vehicle has traveled. Then it should use a loop to display in a list box the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. The image above shows an example of what the application's form should look like once the data is inputted.
